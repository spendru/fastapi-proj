Ah, in that case, let me modify the pipeline to use the Veracode service connection instead of variables. This is actually a better and more secure approach.



```yaml
trigger:
  - main

variables:
  - name: PROJECT_NAME
    value: "your-python-project"
  - name: BUILD_VERSION
    value: "1.0.$(Build.BuildId)"

stages:
  - stage: Build
    jobs:
      - job: BuildAndScan
        pool:
          vmImage: 'ubuntu-latest'
        steps:
          # Install Python dependencies
          - task: UsePythonVersion@0
            inputs:
              versionSpec: '3.x'
              addToPath: true
          
          - script: |
              python -m pip install --upgrade pip
              pip install -r requirements.txt
            displayName: 'Install Dependencies'
          
          # Create source code ZIP for Veracode scanning
          - task: ArchiveFiles@2
            inputs:
              rootFolderOrFile: '$(System.DefaultWorkingDirectory)'
              includeRootFolder: false
              archiveType: 'zip'
              archiveFile: '$(Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory)/source_code.zip'
              replaceExistingArchive: true
            displayName: 'Create Source Code ZIP'
          
          # Submit to Veracode for scanning using service connection
          - task: Veracode@3
            inputs:
              ConnectionDetailsSelection: 'Service Connection'
              AnalysisService: 'your-veracode-connection'  # Replace with your service connection name
              veracodeAppProfile: $(PROJECT_NAME)
              version: $(BUILD_VERSION)
              filepath: $(Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory)/source_code.zip
              failBuildOnPolicyFail: true
              importResults: true
              failBuildOnScanError: true
            displayName: 'Veracode Static Analysis'

```

Key changes I made to use the service connection:

1. Removed the VERACODE_API_ID and VERACODE_API_KEY variables since they're not needed anymore
2. Updated the Veracode task to use version 3 (`Veracode@3`)
3. Added service connection configuration:
   - `ConnectionDetailsSelection: 'Service Connection'`
   - `AnalysisService: 'your-veracode-connection'`

To use this pipeline:

1. Replace `'your-veracode-connection'` with the name of your Veracode service connection
2. Update the `PROJECT_NAME` to match your application name
3. Adjust the `filepath` if your source code is in a specific directory

The service connection approach is more secure because:
- Credentials are managed centrally
- Better access control through Azure DevOps
- No need to handle API credentials in the pipeline variables

Would you like me to help you with any specific configuration or do you need to customize any scanning parameters?
