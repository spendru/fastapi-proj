# --- How to use the function ---

# 1. Define the path to your file that contains the list of filenames.
#    For example, if you have a file named 'my_filenames.txt' in the
#    same directory as your script:
input_file_with_names = "my_filenames.txt"

#    If 'my_filenames.txt' looks like this:
#    file1
#    another_document
#    report_data

# 2. Define the JSON content you want in each file.
#    The problem specifies: { "qry_prms": "-24"}
defined_json_data = {"qry_prms": "-24"}

# 3. Call the function
#    Make sure you have 'my_filenames.txt' (or your specified file)
#    in the correct location with the base filenames listed inside.
#    For example, create a 'my_filenames.txt' with content:
#    alpha
#    beta
#    gamma

# Create the example input file for demonstration if it doesn't exist
if not os.path.exists(input_file_with_names):
    with open(input_file_with_names, 'w') as f:
        f.write("alpha\n")
        f.write("beta.txt\n") # Example with an existing extension
        f.write("gamma\n")
    print(f"Created a sample input file: '{input_file_with_names}' for demonstration.")

create_json_files_from_list(input_file_with_names, defined_json_data)

# This will generate:
# alpha.json with content { "qry_prms": "-24"}
# beta.json with content { "qry_prms": "-24"} (note: .txt was replaced by .json)
# gamma.json with content { "qry_prms": "-24"}
