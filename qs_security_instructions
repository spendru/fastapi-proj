Here are the main approaches:

Method 1: Using Microsoft Graph Change Notifications (Recommended for near real-time)

This is the most direct "webhook-like" mechanism provided by Microsoft Graph. You subscribe to changes on a specific resource (in this case, the members of your target group), and Microsoft Graph sends notifications to your specified HTTPS endpoint when changes occur.

High-Level Steps:

Prepare your AWS Lambda & API Gateway:

Create your AWS Lambda function that contains the logic you want to execute.

Expose this Lambda function via an AWS API Gateway endpoint. This endpoint must be publicly accessible HTTPS. This URL will be your notification endpoint for Microsoft Graph.

Create an Azure AD Application Registration:

You need an identity in Azure AD to authenticate requests to Microsoft Graph for creating and managing the subscription.

Go to the Azure Portal -> Azure Active Directory (or Microsoft Entra ID) -> App registrations -> New registration.

Give it a name (e.g., GroupMembershipNotifierApp).

Configure authentication (e.g., create a client secret or certificate). You'll need these credentials later.

Grant Permissions to the App Registration:

Go to the API permissions section of your App registration.

Add permissions for Microsoft Graph:

Application permissions (since this will run without a signed-in user):

GroupMember.Read.All (or Group.Read.All if you need more group info): To read group memberships.

Subscription.ReadWrite.All: To create, manage, and delete change notification subscriptions.

Grant admin consent for these permissions in your tenant.

Create the Change Notification Subscription:

This is typically done via a script (PowerShell with Microsoft.Graph module, Python with MSAL/Requests, etc.) or an application using the Microsoft Graph API.

You'll make a POST request to the https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/subscriptions endpoint.

Request Body Essentials:

changeType: "created" (if you only want additions. Use "updated" for additions and removals).

notificationUrl: Your AWS API Gateway endpoint URL.

resource: /groups/{group-id}/members (Replace {group-id} with the Object ID of your target Azure AD group).

expirationDateTime: Maximum is usually around 3 days (check current Graph limits). You must plan to renew the subscription before it expires.

clientState: An optional secret string you provide, which Graph will include in notifications, allowing you to verify their authenticity.

Handle the Validation Request (Crucial):

When you create the subscription, Microsoft Graph will immediately send a validation request (HTTP POST) to your notificationUrl (API Gateway).

Your API Gateway/Lambda function must detect this request (it contains a validationToken query parameter).

It must respond within 10 seconds with:

Status Code: 200 OK

Content-Type: text/plain

Body: The exact validationToken value received.

Failure to validate correctly will prevent the subscription from being created.

Process Notifications in AWS Lambda:

Once validated, Graph will send POST requests to your API Gateway endpoint whenever a user is added (or removed, if changeType is "updated") to the group.

The request body contains information about the change, including the resource that changed (the group membership).

Your Lambda function needs to parse this payload and execute your desired logic.

You should also validate the clientState if you provided one during subscription.

Implement Subscription Renewal:

Graph subscriptions expire. You need a mechanism (e.g., a scheduled task, another Lambda/Function) that periodically uses the Graph API to renew (PATCH) the subscription before its expirationDateTime.
