Assume that you are a carrier coach. I am trying to fill out my 3rd quarter performance review. Tasked to fill covering these - As you reflect, think about:

​Skills you’ve built or strengthened

​How you’ve kept learning and growing

​Challenges you’ve tackled or ideas you’ve brought forward

​How you’ve juggled priorities and stayed flexible.



This is a great chance to show your impact this quarter and set the stage for your future goals. To make your review stand out, let's go beyond a simple list of tasks. We'll focus on crafting a narrative that highlights your growth and value.

Here are some prompts to help you reflect on each of the areas. As you answer, try to connect your actions to a specific outcome or result, even if it's small.

Skills You've Built or Strengthened
Think about what new skills you've developed or what existing ones you've improved. Did you learn a new software program, get better at presenting, or master a new technical process?

What new tool or technique did you learn this quarter, and how did it make your work more efficient?

Describe a situation where you had to use a skill you were still developing. What was the outcome?

Did you mentor anyone or share your knowledge with the team? This shows you're strengthening your skills by teaching them.

For example, instead of writing "I learned a new data analysis tool," you could write, "I built on my data analysis skills by learning [Tool Name]. This allowed me to automate our weekly report, saving the team an estimated three hours per week."

How You've Kept Learning and Growing
This section is about your personal and professional development. Did you read an industry report, attend a webinar, or take an online course? Growth isn't always about formal training. It can also be about taking on a new responsibility or seeking out feedback.

Did you volunteer for a project outside your normal duties? What did you learn from it?

How did you apply feedback from a previous review or a colleague?

What industry trend or new knowledge did you bring to the team's attention?

Challenges You've Tackled or Ideas You've Brought Forward
This is where you can showcase your problem-solving abilities and initiative. Don't be afraid to highlight a challenge, as long as you focus on how you overcame it.

Describe a problem that arose and how you were a key part of solving it.

Did you propose a new process or idea that improved how your team works?

Think of a time you had to deal with an unexpected setback. What was your approach, and what was the result?

Instead of saying "I fixed a bug," you could say, "I proactively identified a recurring bug in our system and proposed a new testing protocol that prevented similar issues from happening again."

How You've Juggled Priorities and Stayed Flexible
This section is about demonstrating your adaptability and time management skills. It shows you can handle a dynamic work environment.

Recall a time when your priorities suddenly changed. How did you handle the shift, and what was the result?

How do you manage your workload when you're working on multiple projects?

Can you think of a project where you had to be flexible and adjust your approach based on new information?

For example, you could write, "When our team's project timeline was accelerated, I re-prioritized my tasks and collaborated with [Colleague's Name] to ensure all critical deadlines were still met."

As you write, remember to use strong, action-oriented language. Start your sentences with verbs like managed, created, implemented, streamlined, and initiated. This will help you paint a picture of an active and engaged employee.

Once you have some bullet points for each section, try to weave them together into short, powerful paragraphs. This will make your review feel more like a story of your success this quarter rather than just a list of accomplishments.

Ready to start writing? Let me know if you want to brainstorm some specific examples or refine your bullet points.








Please elaborate on each of these sections. I have learned about Agentic AI for upskilling.


Here are some ways to elaborate on each section of your performance review, with a focus on your skills in Agentic AI. This approach will demonstrate not just that you've learned something new, but that you've applied it to create real value.

Skills You've Built or Strengthened
This is your chance to showcase how your upskilling in Agentic AI has translated into tangible skills. Instead of just saying you "learned about AI," describe the specific, practical skills you've gained.

Prompt Engineering and Human-AI Collaboration: You can describe how you've become proficient in crafting detailed and effective prompts to get the best results from AI agents. This isn't just about typing in a query; it's about understanding how to guide the AI's reasoning, set its goals, and provide the right context. Mention how this skill has allowed you to use AI as a "copilot," not just a tool, to speed up complex tasks.

Workflow Automation and Optimization: Agentic AI is all about creating multi-step, autonomous workflows. You can highlight how you've used your knowledge to identify repetitive or time-consuming processes and then built or implemented an AI agent to automate them. For example, "I developed a workflow using an AI agent to automatically triage and categorize incoming support requests, reducing the manual sorting time by 20%."

Data Literacy and Ethical Oversight: Show that you understand the bigger picture. Your upskilling should include an awareness of the data the agents are using and the ethical considerations of their actions. You can mention that you've developed skills in "evaluating AI outputs for accuracy, bias, and relevance," ensuring the agents you work with are trustworthy and reliable.

How You've Kept Learning and Growing
This section should show your initiative and commitment to staying current in a rapidly evolving field.

Structured Learning and Practical Application: Go beyond simply stating you took a course. Mention a specific learning path you followed (e.g., an online certification, a company workshop, or self-guided study). Then, connect this learning directly to a project. For instance, "I completed the 'Agentic AI in Business' certification, and immediately applied the principles of autonomous goal-setting to my Q3 project, which helped us to achieve the goal ahead of schedule."

Continuous Feedback and Iteration: Agentic AI is a field of constant improvement. Highlight your ability to use a feedback loop to refine your use of AI. Describe how you've "tuned an AI's performance" based on its results, or how you've "conducted A/B tests with different prompts to find the most efficient approach." This shows a proactive, growth-oriented mindset.

Staying Current with Industry Trends: Mention how you stay on top of the latest developments. You can say something like, "I've made it a practice to follow industry publications and thought leaders in the AI space, which led me to propose the use of a new model for our project, resulting in a more efficient outcome."

Challenges You've Tackled or Ideas You've Brought Forward
This is where you demonstrate your value as an innovator and problem-solver.

Solving Complex Problems with a New Approach: Describe a specific challenge that couldn't be solved with traditional methods, but was addressed using an AI agent. For example, "When we faced a bottleneck in our data analysis pipeline, I proposed and then built an AI agent to handle the initial data cleaning and categorization, freeing up the team to focus on higher-level strategic analysis."

Championing New Technology: You can position yourself as a leader in the adoption of new tools. "I saw an opportunity to improve our team's workflow and presented a detailed proposal for integrating an AI agent into our process. I then led a small pilot project to demonstrate its effectiveness, which ultimately led to its wider adoption."

Navigating Unstructured Data: Agentic AI excels at tasks with unstructured data, like summarizing long documents or extracting key information from emails.
